        At the age of 2 in 2008, I started kindargarten at Juja St.Peter's School.
        After 3 years I completed my kindargarten and graduated to primary school in second place out of a class of about 30.
        I battled my way through primary school for eight years and at the end, in 2018, I attained 403/500 marks in my KCPE.
        I was called to Baricho Highschool in Kirinyaga but went to Nairobi School in Westlands instead.
        After for years of working smart, I completed my 4 year highschool course in 2022 with an aggregate of an A- of 79 points.
        On Februrary 2023, I commenced a Boot Camp in: coding, programming, web development and robotics at JKUAT where I am up to date still awaiting KUCCPS to open their university placement portal.
