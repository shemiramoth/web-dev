        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Shem Mugo.
            I was born on the 13th of August 2005 at Nairobi Hospital.
            I was born in a family of 2 as me as the only son who was and still is the last born.

            I went on to live together with my parents since birth at their home where they had settled earlier in the late 90s in Juja.
            I lived happily as a child as I made friends with my neighbours of my age.
