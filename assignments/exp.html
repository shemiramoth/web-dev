        <h1>EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS</h1>
        <P>
            Apart from excelling in education I have also been able to succeed in various co-cirriculur activities such as sports and clubs.
        </P>
        <p>
            In primary school, I played different roles in the chess club, the swimming team, badminton team, table tennis team, the music club and the scouts club.

        </p>
        <h2>Chess Club</h2>
        <p>
            In the chess club, I was able to train and to perfect my skills and technique of playing.
            I was given the chance to represent my school in various chess tournaments.
            I played from the local level up to national level which were held in Kaimosi in Kakamega County.
            After that, I participated in an East Africa tournament held in Makerere University Of Business Studies in Kampala, Uganda.
            Where in the under 14s category I was able to place 4th out of 15.
            I own certificates of all chess tournaments that I participated in.
        </p>
        <h2>Swimming Team</h2>

        <p>
            While in the swimming team, I was able to compete with all my might in different competitions swimming with freestyle and breast stroke which was my major.
            I own various medals and certificates of my performance in the various swimming competitions attended
        </p>
        <h2>Table Tennis and Badminton</h2>

        <p>
            In both table tennis and badminton, I have attended only a few tournaments which I have been able to do very well and lead my teams to victory. 
        </p>
        <h2>Football</h2>
        <p>
            In Highschool, I was very involved in football where I played mostly as a goalkeeper or a defender.
            Using my great composure and profession in the sport, I was able to lead my team to various wins as I was my class's and my house's teams second goalkeeper.
            Furthermore, I also led my class's second team in the field as the team captain.
        </p>
        <h2>Model United Nations</h2>
        <p>
            At the start of highschool, I joined a well known club, the Model United Nations club (MUN) which I played various roles and through my hardwork, I was elected as the club's Chairperson.
            This helped me in nurturing my leadership skills, team building skills and my solution finding tactics.
            In 2019,2021 and 2022, I had a chance to participate in the annual Sub-Saharan Model United Nations (SAIMUN) Conference, two of which were online (due to the covid19 virus) and one was physical and was held at the UNEP headquarters in Gigiri, Nairobi.
            I do have certificates which were awarded to me after the conferences.
            During my service in the MUN club, our club patron described me as the most remarkable and most committed leader.
